# Descrition 
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. In this notebook, I will use supervised machine learning to build an automatic credit card approval predictor just like real banks do. The Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is to be used to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

# Conclusions
While building this credit card predictor, we tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as scaling, label encoding,
and missing value imputation. We finished with some machine learning to predict if a person's application for a credit card would get
approved or not given some information about that person. the best model was Random Forest Classifier and the top important features
were PrioeDefault, CreditScore and YearsEmployed.
