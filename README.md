# Credit-card-applications-using-supervised-machine-learning
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. In this notebook, I will use supervised machine learning to build an automatic credit card approval predictor just like the real banks do. Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is to used to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted
